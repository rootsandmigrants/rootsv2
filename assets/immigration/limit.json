Only select countries were listed individually—mostly from Europe, Canada, China, Japan, and Mexico—while many others were grouped under vague or aggregated categories. 'Asia (except China)' and 'Asia (country unspecified)' include individuals from regions like India, Korea, and Southeast Asia, but without detailed breakdowns. Africa was entirely omitted as a place of birth, likely due to low recorded immigrant counts and  census practices. Similarly, regions such as the Middle East, most of the Caribbean, and Sub-Saharan Africa were absent or lumped under 'Other countries', 'West Indies', or 'Born in other countries'. These gaps reflect both the immigration patterns and the logic of enumeration at the time. Therefore, null values or generalized labels in this dataset should be interpreted as limitations of the original source, not evidence of absence.
